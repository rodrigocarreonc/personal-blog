# Personal Blog
Welcome to the repository for my personal blog! This project serves as the backend and frontend of a simple blogging platform. The blog consists of two primary sections: the Guest Section and the Admin Section. Below is a breakdown of the structure and functionality of each section.

Sections Overview
Guest Section
The Guest Section is accessible to everyone who visits the blog and includes the following pages:

Home Page: Displays a list of articles published on the blog. Visitors can see the titles and short snippets of each article.
Article Page: Displays the full content of an individual article along with the date of publication.
Admin Section
The Admin Section is restricted to authorized users (the blog owner) and allows for the management of articles. This section includes the following pages:

Dashboard: Displays a list of all articles published on the blog. It provides options to add new articles, edit existing ones, or delete articles.
Add Article Page: A form to add a new article to the blog. The form includes fields for:
Title
